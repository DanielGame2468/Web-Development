<h2 class="post-title">What is Java?</h2>
<div class="post-content">
Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, a company
best known for its high-end Unix workstations. Modeled after C++, the Java language was
designed to be small, simple, and portable across platforms and operating systems, both at the
source and at the binary level (more about this later).
Java is often mentioned in the same breath as HotJava, a World Wide Web browser from Sun
like Netscape or Mosaic (see Figure 1.1). What makes HotJava different from most other
browsers is that, in addition to all its basic Web features, it can also download and play applets
on the readerâ€™s system. Applets appear in a Web page much in the same way as images do, but
unlike images, applets are dynamic and interactive. Applets can be used to create animations,
figures, or areas that can respond to input from the reader, games, or other interactive effects on
the same Web pages among the text and graphics.
Although HotJava was the first World Wide Web browser to be able to play Java applets, Java
support is rapidly becoming available in other browsers. Netscape 2.0 provides support for Java
applets, and other browser developers have also announced support for Java in forthcoming
products.
<h3 class="post-title">The Hot Java Browser</h3>
<div class="post-content">
To create an applet, you write it in the Java language, compile it using a Java compiler, and refer
to that applet in your HTML Web pages. You put the resulting HTML and Java files on a Web
site much in the same way that you make ordinary HTML and image files available. Then, when
someone using the HotJava browser (or other Java-aware browser) views your page with the
embedded applet, that browser downloads the applet to the local system and executes it, and
then the reader can view and interact with your applet in all its glory (readers using other
browsers wonâ€™t see anything). Youâ€™ll learn more about how applets, browsers, and the World
Wide Web work together further on in this book.
The important thing to understand about Java is that you can do so much more with it besides
create applets. Java was written as a full-fledged programming language in which you can
accomplish the same sorts of tasks and solve the same sorts of problems that you can in other
programming languages, such as C or C++. HotJava itself, including all the networking, display,
and user interface elements, is written in Java.
<h3 class="post-title">Java's Past, Present, and Future</h3>
<div class="post-content">
The Java language was developed at Sun Microsystems in 1991 as part of a research project to
develop software for consumer electronics devicesâ€”television sets, VCRs, toasters, and the
other sorts of machines you can buy at any department store. Javaâ€™s goals at that time were to
be small, fast, efficient, and easily portable to a wide range of hardware devices. It is those same
goals that made Java an ideal language for distributing executable programs via the World Wide
Web, and also a general-purpose programming language for developing programs that are easily
usable and portable across different platforms.
The Java language was used in several projects within Sun, but did not get very much commercial
attention until it was paired with HotJava. HotJava was written in 1994 in a matter of months,
both as a vehicle for downloading and running applets and also as an example of the sort of
complex application that can be written in Java.
At the time this book is being written, Sun has released the beta version of the Java Developerâ€™s
Kit (JDK), which includes tools for developing Java applets and applications on Sun systems
running Solaris 2.3 or higher for Windows NT and for Windows 95. By the time you read this,
support for Java development may have appeared on other platforms, either from Sun or from
third-party companies.
Note that because the JDK is currently in beta, it is still subject to change between now and when
it is officially released. Applets and applications you write using the JDK and using the examples
in this book may require some changes to work with future versions of the JDK. However,
because the Java language has been around for several years and has been used for several projects,
the language itself is quite stable and robust and most likely will not change excessively. Keep
this beta status in mind as you read through this book and as you develop your own Java
programs.
Support for playing Java programs is a little more confusing at the moment. Sunâ€™s HotJava is
not currently included with the Beta JDK; the only available version of HotJava is an older alpha
version, and, tragically, applets written for the alpha version of Java do not work with the beta
JDK, and vice versa. By the time you read this, Sun may have released a newer version of HotJava
which will enable you to view applets.
The JDK does include an application called appletviewer that allows you to test your Java applets
as you write them. If an applet works in the appletviewer, it should work with any Java-capable
browser. Youâ€™ll learn more about applet viewer later today.
Whatâ€™s in store for the future? In addition to the final Java release from Sun, other companies
have announced support for Java in their own World Wide Web browsers. Netscape Communications Corporation has already incorporated Java capabilities into the 2.0 version of their very
popular Netscape Navigator Web browserâ€”pages with embedded Java applets can be viewed
and played with Netscape. With support for Java available in as popular a browser as Netscape, tools to help develop Java applications (debuggers, development environments, and so on) most
likely will be rapidly available as well.
<h3 class="post-title">Why Learn Java?</h3>
<div class="post-content">
At the moment, probably the most compelling reason to learn Javaâ€”and probably the reason
you bought this bookâ€”is that HotJava applets are written in Java. Even if that were not the case,
Java as a language has significant advantages over other languages and other programming
environments that make it suitable for just about any programming task. This section describes
some of those advantages.

<h3 class="post-title">Java is Platform-Independent</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Platform independence is one of the most significant advantages that Java has over other
programming languages, particularly for systems that need to work on many different platforms.
Java is platform-independent at both the source and the binary level.
Platform-independence is a programâ€™s capability of moving easily from one computer
system to another.
At the source level, Javaâ€™s primitive data types have consistent sizes across all development
platforms. Javaâ€™s foundation class libraries make it easy to write code that can be moved from
platform to platform without the need to rewrite it to work with that platform.
Platform-independence doesnâ€™t stop at the source level, however. Java binary files are also
platform-independent and can run on multiple problems without the need to recompile the
source. How does this work? Java binary files are actually in a form called bytecodes.
Bytecodes are a set of instructions that looks a lot like some machine codes, but that is not
specific to any one processor.
Normally, when you compile a program written in C or in most other languages, the compiler
translates your program into machine codes or processor instructions. Those instructions are
specific to the processor your computer is runningâ€”so, for example, if you compile your code
on a Pentium system, the resulting program will run only on other Pentium systems. If you want
to use the same program on another system, you have to go back to your original source, get a
compiler for that system, and recompile your code. Figure 1.2 shows the result of this system:
multiple executable programs for multiple systems.
Things are different when you write code in Java. The Java development environment has two
parts: a Java compiler and a Java interpreter. The Java compiler takes your Java program and
instead of generating machine codes from your source files, it generates bytecodes.<br>
To run a Java program, you run a program called a bytecode interpreter, which in turn executes
your Java program (see Figure 1.3). You can either run the interpreter by itself, orâ€”for appletsâ€”
there is a bytecode interpreter built into HotJava and other Java-capable browsers that runs the
applet for you.<br>
Why go through all the trouble of adding this extra layer of the bytecode interpreter? Having
your Java programs in bytecode form means that instead of being specific to any one system, your
programs can be run on any platform and any operating or window system as long as the Java
interpreter is available. This capability of a single binary file to be executable across platforms
is crucial to what enables applets to work, because the World Wide Web itself is also platformindependent. Just as HTML files can be read on any platform, so applets can be executed on any
platform that is a Java-capable browser.
The disadvantage of using bytecodes is in execution speed. Because system-specific programs
run directly on the hardware for which they are compiled, they run significantly faster than Java
bytecodes, which must be processed by the interpreter. For many Java programs, the speed may
not be an issue. If you write programs that require more execution speed than the Java interpreter
can provide, you have several solutions available to you, including being able to link native code
into your Java program or using tools to convert your Java bytecodes into native code. Note that
by using any of these solutions, you lose the portability that Java bytecodes provide. Youâ€™ll learn
about each of these mechanisms on Day 20.

<h3 class="post-title">Java is Object-Oriented</h3>
<div class="post-content">
To some, object-oriented programming (OOP) technique is merely a way of organizing
programs, and it can be accomplished using any language. Working with a real object-oriented
language and programming environment, however, enables you to take full advantage of objectoriented methodology and its capabilities of creating flexible, modular programs and reusing
code.
Many of Javaâ€™s object-oriented concepts are inherited from C++, the language on which it is
based, but it borrows many concepts from other object-oriented languages as well. Like most
object-oriented programming languages, Java includes a set of class libraries that provide basic
data types, system input and output capabilities, and other utility functions. These basic classes
are part of the Java development kit, which also has classes to support networking, common
Internet protocols, and user interface toolkit functions. Because these class libraries are written
in Java, they are portable across platforms as all Java applications are.
Youâ€™ll learn more about object-oriented programming and Java tomorrow.

<h3 class="post-title">Java Is Easy to Learn</h3>
<div class="post-content">
In addition to its portability and object-orientation, one of Javaâ€™s initial design goals was to be
small and simple, and therefore easier to write, easier to compile, easier to debug, and, best of
all, easy to learn. Keeping the language small also makes it more robust because there are fewer
chances for programmers to make difficult-to-find mistakes. Despite its size and simple design,
however, Java still has a great deal of power and flexibility.<br>
Java is modeled after C and C++, and much of the syntax and object-oriented structure is
borrowed from the latter. If you are familiar with C++, learning Java will be particularly easy for
you, because you have most of the foundation already.
Although Java looks similar to C and C++, most of the more complex parts of those languages
have been excluded from Java, making the language simpler without sacrificing much of its
power. There are no pointers in Java, nor is there pointer arithmetic. Strings and arrays are real
objects in Java. Memory management is automatic. To an experienced programmer, these
omissions may be difficult to get used to, but to beginners or programmers who have worked
in other languages, they make the Java language far easier to learn.

<h3 class="post-title">Getting Started with Programming in Java</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Enough background! Letâ€™s finish off this day by creating two real Java programs: a stand-alone
Java application and an applet that you can view in either in the appletviewer (part of the JDK)
or in a Java-capable browser. Although both these programs are extremely simple, they will give
you an idea of what a Java program looks like and how to compile and run it.

<h3 class="post-title">Getting the Software</h3>
<div class="post-content">
In order to write Java programs, you will, of course, need a Java development environment. At
the time this book is being written, Sunâ€™s Java Development Kit provides everything you need
to start writing Java programs. The JDK is available for Sun SPARC systems running Solaris 2.2
or higher and for Windows NT and Windows 95. You can get the JDK from several places:<br>
â–  The CD-ROM that came with this book contains the full JDK distribution. See the
CD information for installation instructions.<br>
â–  The JDK can be downloaded from Sunâ€™s Java FTP site at ftp://java.sun.com/pub/ or
from a mirror site (ftp://www.blackdown.org/pub/Java/pub/is one).<br>
<b>Note:</b> The Java Development Kit is currently in beta release. By the time you read
this, The JDK may be available for other platforms, or other organizations may be
selling Java development tools as well.
Although Netscape and other Java-aware browsers provide an environment for playing Java
applets, they do not provide a mechanism for developing Java applications. For that, you need
separate toolsâ€”merely having a browser is not enough.

<h3 class="post-title">Applets and Applications</h3>
<div class="post-content">
Java applications fall into two main groups: applets and applications.
Applets, as you have learned, are Java programs that are downloaded over the World Wide Web
and executed by a Web browser on the readerâ€™s machine. Applets depend on a Java-capable
browser in order to run (although they can also be viewed using a tool called the appletviewer,
which youâ€™ll learn about later today).
Java applications are more general programs written in the Java language. Java applications donâ€™t
require a browser to run, and in fact, Java can be used to create most other kinds of applications
that you would normally use a more conventional programming language to create. HotJava
itself is a Java application.
A single Java program can be an applet or an application or both, depending on how you write
that program and the capabilities that program uses. Throughout this first week, youâ€™ll be
writing mostly HotJava applications; then youâ€™ll apply what youâ€™ve learned to write applets in
Week 2. If youâ€™re eager to get started with applets, be patient. Everything that you learn while
youâ€™re creating simple Java applications will apply to creating applets, and itâ€™s easier to start with
the basics before moving onto the hard stuff. Youâ€™ll be creating plenty of applets in Week 2.
